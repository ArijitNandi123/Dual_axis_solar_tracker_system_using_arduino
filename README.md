# Dual_axis_solar_tracker_system_using_arduino
Spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge dual-axis solar tracker as a key project during my college tenure. The project aimed to enhance solar energy harvesting by dynamically aligning solar panels with the optimal position relative to the sun's movement throughout the day.
